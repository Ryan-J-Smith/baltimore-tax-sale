If you're reading this, you're probably looking for information about the Baltimore City Tax Sale.  If you're looking to actually participate in the sale, head on over to the city's official auction site at [BidBaltimore.com](http://www.bidbaltimore.com).  If instead you're looking for more information about the auction itself and the data behind it, you've come to the right place.

I've begun aggregating data related to the Baltimore Tax Sale in hopes of being able to get some questions answered.  In the coming weeks I will be doing this analysis and posting my findings as they come along.

There are two main aspects of the data that I intend to investigate.  The first is related to the people and the properties involved on the **selling** end of the auction.  Along this line of analysis I will address questions like:

* How many vacant properties are included in the auction?
* How many properties are owner occupied?
* Where are these properties located?
* What are the demographics associated with the owners of these properties?

The other avenue of analysis will focus on those on the **buying** end of the auction.

* Who exactly is participating in these auctions?
* Which properties are people bidding on and how much are they bidding?
* What are the bidding strategies being applied and how successful are they?

In addition to sharing my analysis of these questions, I will do my best to share the source data where I can.
