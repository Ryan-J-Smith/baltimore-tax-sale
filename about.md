This site is intended to host analysis and associated data related to the Baltimore Tax Sale.

## What is the Baltimore Tax Sale? (Short version)

Every year, Baltimore hosts an auction of tax lien certificates.  In brief, individuals in the city who owe unpaid property taxes or certain other fees such as water bills can have a lien placed against their property.  These lien certificates are put up for sale at an annual auction at [www.BidBaltimore.com](http://www.bidbaltimore.com).  Individuals may participate in the auction and bid on the certificates.

If a bidder wins a certificate at auction, Baltimore collects payment in the amount of the lien.  The property owner now owes money to the winning bidder in the amount of the lien plus 18% simple interest.  If the property owner fails to pay off the lien within one year, the holder of the lien certificate may foreclose on the property.

## What is the purpose of this blog?

I've begun aggregating data related to the Baltimore Tax Sale in hopes of being able to get some questions answered.  In the coming weeks I will be gathering data, analyzing it, and posting my findings.

There are two main aspects of the data that I intend to investigate.  The first is related to the people and the properties involved on the **selling** end of the auction.  Along this line of analysis I will address questions like:

* How many vacant properties are included in the auction?
* How many properties are owner occupied?
* Where are these properties located?
* What are the demographics associated with the owners of these properties?

The other avenue of analysis will focus on those on the **buying** end of the auction.

* Who exactly is participating in these auctions?
* Which properties are people bidding on and how much are they bidding?
* What are the bidding strategies being applied and how successful are they?

In addition to sharing my analysis of these questions, I will do my best to share the source data where I can.
