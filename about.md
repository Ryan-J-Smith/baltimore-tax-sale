## What is the Baltimore Tax Sale?

Every year, Baltimore hosts an auction of tax lien certificates.  In brief, individuals in the city who owe unpaid property taxes or certain other fees such as water bills can have a lien placed against their property.  These liens are put up for sale at an annual auction at [www.BidBaltimore.com](http://www.bidbaltimore.com).
